Ideas
	General Class: Varied mana/turn, varied max mana. Mana doesn't reset per turn.
	General Class: Varied card draw/turn, varied max hand size.
	Warrior: Does mostly physical damage and block. Can do occasional elemental damage.
	Wizard: No card draw (except turn 1). Most cards played also draw card. Lots of high
		cost cards. High mana limit.  Lots of elemental damage, and ways of changing
		type of elemental damage.
	Assassin: Stealth-heavy, bonuses in stealth. 
	Summoner: Summons in allies. Reduce mana/turn per ally.
	
	MAP: Circular map with city at center, and occasional towns along the way.
		Big boss starts at outside, and slowly spreads influence.
		Nodes influenced by big boss are more severe. 
		Can move in any direction; nodes will refresh after a while. But don't
		take too long, or boss will overrun map.
		Fog of War? Or show whole map all the time?
	
	ENEMIES: Enemies have decks, mana, card draw as well, instead of fixed 
		actions. Cards can have weights like current actions.
