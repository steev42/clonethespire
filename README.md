This project started life as a youtube tutorial to learn Godot as a Slay the Spire clone.
(see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgh_neTJG8&list=PL6SABXRSlpH8CD71L7zye311cp9R4JazJ)

Since then, it has evolved somewhat, as I try to branch out on my own. There 
are still lots of Slay the Spire influences, but I hope over time to make it more 
of its own thing.
